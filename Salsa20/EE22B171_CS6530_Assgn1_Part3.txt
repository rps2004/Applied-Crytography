Part 3: Benchmarking Salsa20 Implementation

Files Used:
-------------
1. salsa-ref.c
2. ecrypt-sync.h
3. ecrypt-portable.h
4. test.c (for benchmarking DJ Bernstein's implementation)
4. bench_salsa.py (for benchmarking Python implementation)

Modifications Made:
-------------------
- No changes were made to the original Salsa20 algorithm; it runs its standard 20-round configuration.
- Test file (test.c) created to benchmark the C implementation on a 1 MB input file.

How to Test:
-------------
- Run C implementation: salsa_c.exe
- Run Python implementation: bench_salsa.py

Analysis:
---------
- The C implementation is significantly faster than the Python implementation.
- Reasons for the speed advantage:
  1. Low-level optimizations in C, including manual memory handling.
  2. Compiled nature of C, which generates machine-level code directly.
  3. Efficient arithmetic operations and minimal loop overhead.
  4. Python’s interpreted nature adds runtime overhead.

Conclusion:
-----------
- Salsa20 C implementation demonstrates the efficiency of low-level languages for cryptography.
- Python implementation is suitable for prototyping or small data but is slower for large-scale encryption tasks.
- Performance-critical cryptography libraries are often written in C or C++.

Notes / Observations:
---------------------
- Both implementations produced correct outputs for the test input.
- Further speed improvement in Python could be achieved using libraries like PyCryptodome, which internally use C extensions.
